# Code-Quiz

Welcome to my coding quiz!  This was a very difficult assignment for me.  I struggled with the functions and building them.  Thanks to my tutor, we worked through them together and it really helped me to learn and become a little more comfortable with how they perform.  I probably coded this 3 ways, including the final, which helped with learning but made me seriously question my ability to finish this BootCamp.

In order to get back on track with the modules, I had to sort of daraw a line and not spend more time to figure out the localstorage so the final 2 elements "Go back" and "High Score" are not finished.  I hope to come back when i have more knowledge and complete them.
